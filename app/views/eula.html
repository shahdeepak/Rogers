</p>
<p class="center-text">
    <span class="bold-text">ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS ACTIONS.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span class="bold-text">THIS SECTION OF THE AGREEMENT INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. IT LIMITS CERTAIN OF YOUR
        RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION AGAINST US OR TO BRING CLASS ACTION
        CLAIMS AGAINST US
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span class="bold-text">IF YOU ARE A SUBSCRIBER TO THE REDBOX INSTANT BY VERIZON SERVICE, THIS LICENSE IS SUBJECT TO
        THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS OF YOUR REDBOX INSTANT BY VERIZON TERMS OF SERVICE, AS AMENDED FROM
        TIME TO TIME. IF YOU ARE NOT A SUBSCRIBER TO THE REDBOX INSTANT BY VERIZON SERVICE, THIS
        LICENSE IS SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THIS SECTION II.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    WE HOPE TO MAKE YOU A HAPPY CUSTOMER, AND THAT ALL ISSUES RELATED TO THE APPLICATION CAN BE RESOLVED
    THROUGH OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT, WHICH CAN BE REACHED BY GOING TO THE CONTACT US LINK ON OUR
    WEBSITE, <span class="bold-text">HTTP://REDBOXINSTANT.COM/SUPPORT/</span>. <span class="bold-text">BUT IF THERE'S AN
    ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED, THIS SECTION OUTLINES WHAT'S EXPECTED OF BOTH OF US.</span> YOU
    AND VERIZON BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ONLY BY ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THERE IS NO
    JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND THE PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT, BUT AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU
    THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AS A COURT WOULD. IF
    THE LAW ALLOWS FOR AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THEM TOO. WE ALSO BOTH AGREE
    THAT:
</p>
<p>
<ol type="A">
    <li>THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT. EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT CASES THAT QUALIFY, ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR FROM THE APPLICATION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DISPUTE BASED ON A FEDERAL OR STATE STATUTE, WILL BE RESOLVED BY ONE OR MORE NEUTRAL ARBITRATORS BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA") OR BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU ("BBB"). YOU CAN ALSO BRING ANY ISSUES YOU MAY HAVE TO THE ATTENTION OF FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND IF THE LAW ALLOWS, THEY CAN SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US FOR YOU.
    </li>
    <li>UNLESS YOU AND VERIZON AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE COUNTY OF YOUR BILLING ADDRESS (OR, IF A BILLING ADDRESS IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE NOTICE ADDRESS FOR THE CUSTOMER AS REFLECTED IN THE FILES OF VERIZON). FOR CLAIMS OVER $10,000, THE AAA'S ARBITRATION RULES WILL APPLY; IN SUCH CASES, THE LOSER CAN ASK FOR A PANEL OF THREE NEW ARBITRATORS TO REVIEW THE AWARD. FOR CLAIMS OF $10,000 OR LESS, THE PARTY BRINGING THE CLAIM CAN CHOOSE EITHER THE AAA'S RULES OR THE BBB'S RULES FOR BINDING ARBITRATION OR, ALTERNATIVELY, CAN BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. YOU CAN GET PROCEDURES, RULES AND FEE INFORMATION FROM THE AAA (WWW.ADR.ORG), THE BBB (WWW.BBB.ORG) OR FROM US. FOR CLAIMS OF $10,000 OR LESS, YOU CAN CHOOSE WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE THE ARBITRATION CARRIED OUT BASED ONLY ON DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED TO THE ARBITRATOR, OR BY A HEARING IN–PERSON OR BY PHONE.
    </li>
    <li>THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS EVEN IF THE AAA OR BBB PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DETERMINE THAT CLASS ARBITRATION IS PERMISSIBLE. THE ARBITRATOR ALSO SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO PRESIDE OVER CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION, OR TO AWARD ANY FORM OF CLASSWIDE OR COLLECTIVE REMEDY. INSTEAD, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE POWER TO AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR PRAYERS FOR RELIEF MAY BE MAINTAINED IN ANY ARBITRATION HELD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. NO AAA OR BBB RULE WILL APPLY IF IT CONFLICTS WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY CONTRARY PROVISION IN THE AAA OR BBB RULES, THE ARBITRATOR WILL BE BOUND TO APPLY LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND THE LAWS THAT GOVERN THIS AGREEMENT, AND DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO AWARD ANY RELIEF THAT IS NOT AUTHORIZED BY SUCH LAWS.
    </li>
    <li>IF EITHER OF US INTENDS TO SEEK ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTY SEEKING ARBITRATION MUST FIRST NOTIFY THE OTHER PARTY OF THE DISPUTE IN WRITING AT LEAST 30 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF INITIATING THE ARBITRATION. NOTICE TO VERIZON SHOULD BE SENT TO NOTICEOFDISPUTE@VERIZON.COM OR TO VERIZON DISPUTE RESOLUTION MANAGER, ONE VERIZON WAY, VC52N061, BASKING RIDGE, NJ 07920. THE NOTICE MUST DESCRIBE THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM AND THE RELIEF BEING SOUGHT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE OUR DISPUTE WITHIN 30 DAYS, EITHER PARTY MAY THEN PROCEED TO FILE A CLAIM FOR ARBITRATION. NOTICE TO THE CUSTOMER SHALL BE GIVEN TO THE CUSTOMER'S BILLING ADDRESS (OR, IF A BILLING ADDRESS IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE NOTICE ADDRESS FOR THE CUSTOMER AS REFLECTED IN THE FILES OF VERIZON). VERIZON WILL PAY ANY FILING FEE THAT THE AAA OR BBB CHARGES YOU FOR ARBITRATION OF THE DISPUTE. IF YOU PROVIDE US WITH SIGNED WRITTEN NOTICE THAT YOU CANNOT PAY THE FILING FEE, VERIZON WILL PAY THE FEE DIRECTLY TO THE AAA OR BBB. IF THAT ARBITRATION PROCEEDS, WE'LL ALSO PAY ANY ADMINISTRATIVE AND ARBITRATOR FEES CHARGED LATER, AS WELL AS FOR ANY APPEAL TO A PANEL OF THREE NEW ARBITRATORS (IF THE ARBITRATION AWARD IS APPEALABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT). NOTICE TO THE CUSTOMER SHALL BE GIVEN TO THE CUSTOMER'S BILLING ADDRESS (OR, IF A BILLING ADDRESS IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE NOTICE ADDRESS FOR THE CUSTOMER AS REFLECTED IN THE FILES OF VERIZON)
    </li>
    <li>WE MAY, BUT ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO, MAKE A WRITTEN SETTLEMENT OFFER ANYTIME BEFORE ARBITRATION BEGINS. THE AMOUNT OR TERMS OF ANY SETTLEMENT OFFER MAY NOT BE DISCLOSED TO THE ARBITRATOR UNTIL AFTER THE ARBITRATOR ISSUES AN AWARD ON THE CLAIM. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE OFFER AND THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS YOU AN AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS MORE THAN OUR OFFER BUT LESS THAN $5000, OR IF WE DO NOT MAKE YOU AN OFFER, AND THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS YOU ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT LESS THAN $5000, THEN WE AGREE TO PAY YOU $5000 INSTEAD OF THE AMOUNT AWARDED. IN THAT CASE WE ALSO AGREE TO PAY ANY REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LAW REQUIRES IT FOR YOUR CASE. IF THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS YOU MORE THAN $5000, THEN WE WILL PAY YOU THAT AMOUNT.
    </li>
    <li>AN ARBITRATION AWARD AND ANY JUDGMENT CONFIRMING IT APPLY ONLY TO THAT SPECIFIC CASE; IT CANNOT
        BE USED IN ANY OTHER CASE EXCEPT TO ENFORCE THE AWARD ITSELF.
    </li>
    <li>IF FOR SOME REASON THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN SUBSECTION II.C.
        CANNOT BE ENFORCED, THEN THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL NOT APPLY.
    </li>
    <li>IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND VERIZON
        AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND VERIZON UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO
        TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
        AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN
        CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.
