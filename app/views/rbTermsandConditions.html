The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Redbox Platforms from that point forward.  Updated Terms will apply to your reservations or rental transactions that begin after the Updated Terms are effective.</div>

     <div><strong>YOUR LICENSE TO USE MATERIALS</strong></div>
     <div>Subject to your strict compliance with these Terms, and only with respect to Materials available on or through the Redbox Platforms, excluding any media or product you rent or purchase from Redbox (“Items”), Redbox grants you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-commercial, revocable, non-assignable and non-transferable license to download, view and/or play one copy of such Materials on any single computer or other device for your personal, non-commercial use only.

     <div><strong>COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</strong></div>
     <div>You may not use the Redbox Platforms for any purpose or in any manner that infringes the rights of any third party.

     <div>Please also note that the information provided in the legal notice you submit may be forwarded to the person who provided the allegedly infringing content.</div>
     <div>Under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.</div>
     <div>We have a policy of terminating the accounts of users who (in our reasonable discretion) are repeat infringers.</div>

     <div><strong>USER COMMENTS AND POSTINGS</strong></div>
     <div>We may provide user comment areas, message boards or other interactive areas on the Redbox Platforms (“Community Forums”) to give users of the Redbox Platforms a forum to express their opinions and share their ideas, information, materials, and other user-generated content (each, “User Content”). </div>
     <div>Rights You Grant to Us.  Subject to applicable laws, whenever you send, post, upload, or otherwise make available User Content on a Community Forum or elsewhere on the Redbox Platforms or directly to Redbox (including by e-mail or text message) you: (1) grant to Redbox an irrevocable, worldwide, nonexclusive, perpetual, fully sub-licensable and assignable, royalty-free license to use, exploit, reproduce, modify, translate, incorporate in other works, create derivative works from, publish, broadcast and perform that User Content and your name, voice, likeness and other identifying information in connection with that User Content via any media now known or later developed, without any compensation to you, and (2) waive all of your moral rights in that User Content, even if the User Content is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you.  Subject to applicable laws, you further authorize Redbox to publish your User Content in a searchable format that may be accessed by users of the Redbox Platforms and the Internet.</div>
     <div>No Responsibility.  We are not responsible for, and we do not endorse, the User Content posted in Community Forums or elsewhere on the Redbox Platforms.</div>
     <div>No Obligation to Prescreen/Monitor. We do not have, and do not undertake, any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any User Content.  However, we retain the right (but not the obligation), in our sole discretion and for any reason, to prescreen, monitor, edit, refuse to accept, post, remove, or move any User Content. Because we may not prescreen User Content, if your User Content contains offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable content, or infringes on the rights of any third parties, you may bear legal responsibility for that User Content.  You agree that Redbox has no obligation to monitor or enforce your intellectual property rights to your User Content, but has the right to protect and enforce its and its licensees' licensed rights to your User Content.</div>
     <div>No Confidential Relationship/No Unsolicited Materials. Except as otherwise described in the Redbox Privacy Policy, any User Content will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of User Content. You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Redbox is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any User Content does not place Redbox in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your User Content. None of your User Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Redbox, and Redbox will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any User Content that you provide.</div>
     <div>It is our policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have specifically requested, to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Redbox does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted.</div>
     <div>No Obligation to Use. You agree and understand that we are not obligated to post, keep or use your User Content.</div>
     <div>ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY</div>
     <div>The following rules are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of you when you participate on any Community Forums or other interactive areas of the Redbox Platforms. You agree that your participation in a Community Forum or other interactive area of the Redbox Platforms is subject to all the Terms, including the following:</div>
     <div>Acceptable Use Policy:</div>
     <div>
       <ul>
         <li>User Content must be yours please. All User Content must be in the public domain or original with you, not copied from someone else's work, and you must have all rights in the User Content; OR, all persons who contributed in any way or have any rights to your User Content or otherwise appear in the User Content have given you permission to upload and distribute the User Content on the Redbox Platforms and elsewhere.</li>
         <li>No pictures or images of anyone but you and your friends and family. If you choose to upload photos to the Redbox Platforms, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know but only with their express permission to post it.</li>
         <li>Don't upload third party materials. Your User Content should not contain any visible logos, phrases or trademarks or other third party materials. Do not use any User Content that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own. This includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet.</li>
         <li>Do not include music that isn't yours. Your User Content may not contain any music unless the work and performance is original with you and/or you have all rights to the musical work (including any performances). No jingles, sampling or otherwise.</li>
         <li>Keep it relevant. Your User Content should relate to the content on the Redbox Platforms and should be intended to add to the discussion and community on the Redbox Platforms - it should not include irrelevant topics or postings (this is not the place to discuss politics, religion, or private matters).</li>
         <li>Please follow codes of social decency. Express yourself with non-offensive individual self-expression. Be respectful of others' opinions and comments so we can continue to build a Community Forum for everyone to enjoy. If you think your User Content might offend someone, chances are it probably will and it doesn't belong on a Community Forum. Cursing, harassing, stalking, posting insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip or similar actions are prohibited. Your User Content may not threaten abuse or harm others. Your User Content may not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual preference or physical handicap or that are defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic or sexually explicit.</li>
         <li>Do not use a Community Forum for commercial purposes. Your User Content may not advertise or promote a product or service except those provided on the Redbox Platforms. You may not use your User Content to raise money for anyone or for a pyramid or other multi-tiered marketing scheme.</li>
         <li>Do not upload User Content that is inappropriate or illegal. Your User Content may not promote any illegal activity. If someone could go to jail or incur civil or criminal penalties for taking action suggested by your User Content, don't upload or post it. If you do upload or post User Content that is illegal or in violation of applicable law, we reserve the right to take action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion, including reporting you to the proper governmental authorities.</li>
         <li>No violence. Your User Content may not promote violence or describe how to perform a violent act.</li>
         <li>Be honest and do not misrepresent yourself or your User Content. Do not impersonate any other person, user or company or upload or post User Content that you know is false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, misleading or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company.</li>
         <li>Public forum. We hope that you will use each Community Forum to exchange information and content and have discussions with other members. However, please remember that a Community Forum is a public forum and User Content that you post on a Community Forum will be accessible and viewable by other users. Do not post personal information (e.g., full name, password, phone number, address, e-mail address or other personally identifiable information or contact information). </li>
         <li>Video Privacy Protection Act .  You acknowledge that if you post your User Content to a Community Forum, including any information about your movie or other rentals, you are choosing to do so and the federal Video Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (18 U.S.C. § 2710), Connecticut General Statute § 53-450, Michigan Law § 445.1712, Maryland Code Article 27 § 583, and similarly-worded state or other video privacy laws or regulations do not apply.  However, to the extent that any of those laws or regulations do apply in any manner, you are providing your informed, written consent to the disclosure of that information pursuant to the law or regulation.</li>
         <li>Don't share other people's personal information. Your User Content may not reveal another person's address, phone number, e-mail address, credit card number or any information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual or that is extremely personal in nature.</li>
         <li>Don't damage the Redbox Platforms or anyone's computers. User Content may not contain viruses, Trojan horses, spyware or any other technologies that could impact the operation of the Redbox Platforms or any computer system.</li>
       </ul>
     </div>
     <div>In cases where you feel threatened or believe someone else is in danger, you should contact your local law enforcement agency immediately.</div>
     <div>VIRAL CONTENT DISTRIBUTION</div>
     <div>Redbox may grant you -- but only through express written permission -- the limited, revocable permission to engage in certain expressly described personal uses of Materials as may from time to time be made available via forms of digital delivery on the Redbox Platforms for such purpose ("Viral Distribution"). Express written permission for Viral Distribution may include these personal uses: (a) sending Materials to friends or acquaintances at no charge; (b) posting and displaying a copy of Materials on a personal web site; or (c) posting and displaying a copy of Materials on a third party web site that permits users to post content, so long as the posting is allowed pursuant to the third party site terms and conditions, and provided that the third party web site does not charge for access to those materials or associate those materials with products, services or advertising.  If expressly permitted and made available on the Redbox Platforms, you may engage in Viral Distribution pursuant to these Terms, but you will not make any use of or license, distribute, reproduce, or otherwise exploit any part of the Materials without our express written permission.</div>
     <div>USER INTERACTIONS AND DISPUTES</div>
     <div>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Redbox Platforms, whether online or offline. We are not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment in your interactions with others, when you submit or post any personal or other information, and in all other online activities.</div>
     <div>MEMBERSHIP & REGISTRATION</div>
     <div>Certain areas of the Redbox Platforms may require registration or may otherwise ask you to provide information to participate in certain features or access certain Materials or User Content. The decision to provide this information is purely optional; however, if you elect not to provide such information, you may not be able to access certain Materials or User Content or participate in certain features of the Redbox Platforms. When you provide information to the Redbox Platforms, you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information and to update it as necessary to maintain its truth and accuracy.<br/>
         If you register with us, you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password, if any, and you agree you will not sell, transfer or assign your membership or any membership rights. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, if any, and for restricting access to your computer (or other Internet access device, as applicable) so that others may not access the password protected portion of the Redbox Platforms using your name in whole or in part. Redbox reserves the right to terminate your account or otherwise deny you access in its sole discretion without notice and without liability.</div>
     <div>SALES</div>
     <div>All sales, unless stated otherwise at the time of sale, are final and non-returnable, except as required by applicable law.</div>
     <div>SWEEPSTAKES, CONTESTS, AND PROMOTIONS</div>
     <div>Any sweepstakes, contests or other promotions (any, a “Promotion”) that may be offered via the Redbox Platforms may be governed by a separate set of rules that may have eligibility requirements, such as certain age or geographic area restrictions, terms and conditions governing the Promotion, use of User Content, and disclosures about how your personal information may be used.  It is your responsibility to read these rules to determine whether or not you want to and are eligible to participate, register and/or enter, and to determine the applicable terms and conditions of the Promotion. By participating in a Promotion, you will be subject to those official rules, and you agree to comply with and abide by such rules and the decisions of the identified sponsor(s).</div>
     <div>WIDGETS & APPLICATIONS</div>
     <div>The Redbox Platforms may provide certain Materials that you may choose to include on your personal web page, third party web site or social networking site (“Personal Page”) by pasting the HTML or other code provided by us and labeled as an embed code (or similar identifying label) (“Embed Code”) into your Personal Page (“Widget”). For any Widgets that we make available on the Redbox Platforms, we grant you a revocable permission, subject to the restrictions in these Terms, to include the Embed Code as provided by us (without editing) for inclusion only on your Personal Page and only on a site that: (i) permits you to post the Widget there; and (ii) does not have terms of use or other conditions that purport to give that site operator any interest or right in or to our Embed Code or Materials other than to obtain a limited, terminable right to host the Widget and permit its normal operation.

You agree that you will not embed or otherwise make available a Widget on a web page or other location in violation of the prior sentence or that contains content that is distasteful, unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable (in our sole opinion). We make no specific warranties about Widgets and we may discontinue providing the services necessary for the Widgets to operate at any time for any reason without any liability to you.  In addition, we may disable Widgets that you include on your Personal Page(s) if you violate these Terms (as determined by us in our sole discretion), or for any or no reason, without any liability to you. You agree that our permission to you to use Widgets on your Personal Page does not provide you (or any third party) with any intellectual property rights in or to the Widget or the Materials made available via any Widget. You agree to not make any commercial use of any Widget or the Materials made available in a Widget, in whole or in part, nor to sell, lease, hypothecate, transfer, license, encumber or otherwise exploit same, in whole or in part, or purport to give any third party permission to do so. This includes a prohibition on you or a third party overlaying or otherwise associating advertising with the Widget or Materials. You agree to include, and not remove or alter, our  trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights notices, as provided by us on a Widget, Widget code or Materials made available via a Widget and you agree to comply with Widget usage guidelines that may be provided by us from time to time. You agree not to circumvent (or in any way attempt to circumvent) the security or rights management features in a Widget or any component of a Widget that are designed to prevent users from copying, manipulating or retaining the Materials made available via a Widget.  You also agree to not use (or attempt to use) any Widget, or any component of a Widget, to display content other than the specific Materials provided or intended by us to be displayed via a particular Widget.

         NOTICE TO THIRD PARTY SITES:  Any of our Materials made available in connection with your site, or otherwise, by our Widgets, third party widgets or otherwise is our exclusive property and no grant of any intellectual property rights is made by us.  We retain the right to demand that you cease any use of our Materials upon notice and you will do so.

         You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that connect a Redbox Platform or your profile on a Redbox Platform with a third party site (each, an “Application”) and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your Redbox Platform profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information relating to your Redbox Platform accounts, you are consenting to the information about your account being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Redbox has not provided such information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold Redbox harmless for the sharing of information relating to your Redbox Platform accounts that results from your use of an Application. You must read all log-in boxes and other pop-up boxes closely for notices about sharing your account information with, through or by any other means identified on an Application.</div>
     <div>THIRD PARTY LINKS, APPLICATIONS AND CONTENT</div>

Accessing those third party sites requires you to leave the Redbox Platforms.
