Except as described above, this policy applies across the Verizon family of companies and the products and services they provide. The Verizon family of companies includes the companies and joint ventures controlled by Verizon, including the Verizon telephone companies, Verizon Wireless, Verizon Online and Redbox Instant by Verizon.</div>

						<div class="title3">Information About the Cable Act</div>
						<div>To the extent that Section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Cable Act") applies to services you purchase, it entitles you to know about the personally identifiable information a cable service provider collects. This includes the nature of the use and disclosure of this information and to whom it may be disclosed, how long personally identifiable information is maintained, and how subscribers may access it. In addition, the Cable Act imposes limits on the collection and disclosure of personal information and gives subscribers the ability to enforce their privacy rights. (Personally identifiable information does not include aggregate data that does not identify a particular person).<br></div>
						<div>The Cable Act allows a provider to use its cable system to collect personally identifiable information necessary to render a cable service or other services provided to subscribers and to detect and prevent unauthorized access to services. Additional personally identifiable information may be collected with the subscriber’s prior consent. Personally identifiable information may be used or disclosed without the subscriber’s consent where necessary to render services, and to conduct legitimate business activities related to services provided.</div>
						<div>We may be required by law to disclose personally identifiable information to a governmental entity to comply with valid legal process, such as warrants, court orders or subpoenas, but we will not disclose records revealing your selection of video programming unless we receive a court order indicating that the governmental entity has made a specified showing of relevance and you were afforded an opportunity to contest the order. We may be required to disclose personally identifiable information (including your selection of video programming) to a non-governmental entity to comply with a court order, after you have been provided notice.</div>
						<div>If you believe that your privacy rights have been violated, please contact us at privacyoffice@verizon.com and we will work with you to address your concerns. If you believe that you have been aggrieved as a result of a violation of the Cable Act, you may enforce the limitations imposed by the Cable Act through a civil action in a United States district court seeking damages, attorney's fees, and litigation costs. Other rights and remedies may also be available to you under federal or other applicable laws.</div>
						<div>The Cable Act permits the disclosure of customer names and addresses as long as a subscriber has been provided with the opportunity to prohibit or limit this disclosure and the disclosure does not reveal, directly or indirectly, the subscriber’s viewing or other uses of the cable or other services provided. If we intend to share data in this way, we will provide you with the opportunity to prohibit or limit this type of sharing.</div>

						<div>Verizon’s Relevant TV Advertising program helps advertisers reach FiOS television customers with advertisements that may be more relevant to their interests. We do not share any information that identifies you personally outside of Verizon as part of this program.

We help advertisers deliver ads to audiences based on demographic and interest information (such as gender, family size, and luxury car owner) we obtain from other companies, your address and certain information about your Verizon products and services (such as service packages purchased, video on-demand purchases, and program viewing data).

Sharing this information allows us to provide you with the latest information about our products and services and to offer you our latest promotions.</div>
						<div>Additional protections apply for certain information we collect and maintain about the telecommunications and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services you buy from us and how you use them.

						<div>Verizon uses vendors and partners for a variety of business purposes such as to help us offer, provide, repair and bill for services we provide. We share information with those vendors and partners when it is necessary for them to perform work on our behalf. For example, we may provide your credit card information and billing address to our payment processing company solely for the purpose of processing payment for a transaction you have requested. We require that these vendors and partners protect the customer information we provide to them and limit their use of Verizon customer data to the purposes for which it was provided. We do not permit these types of vendors and partners to use this information for their own marketing purposes.</div>
						<div>As described in more detail in other sections of this policy, Verizon also may share certain information with outside companies-, for example, to assist with the delivery of advertising campaigns, or preparing and sharing aggregate reports.</div>

These companies, often called ad servers, ad networks, or technology platforms, may place and access cookies on your device to collect information about your visit on our websites. The information they collect from our sites is in a form that does not identify you personally. This information may be combined with similar data obtained from other websites to help advertisers better reach their targeted audiences.

						<div>If you choose to interact with specific advertisers who advertise on our sites or services, the information you provide to them is subject to the conditions of their specific privacy policies. In addition, responding to or interacting with a particular advertisement, may result in you later receiving a targeted advertisement on our websites or on other sites as a result of an ad server or ad network concluding that you fit within a particular audience an advertiser is trying to reach.</div>
						<div>Advertising that is customized based on predictions generated from your visits over time and across different websites is sometimes called "online behavioral" or "interest-based" advertising. In accordance with industry self-regulatory principles, we require that companies disclose when they are using online behavioral advertising programs to deliver third-party ads on our sites or collecting information about your visit to our sites for these purposes and give consumers the ability to opt-out of this use of their information. You will see an icon in or around third-party advertisements that are delivered on our sites using behavioral advertising programs. Clicking on this icon will provide additional information about the companies and data practices that were used to deliver the ad as well as information on how you may opt-out of these advertising programs. Additional information about your options regarding the use of your information for advertising purposes can be found below. Additional information about online behavioral advertising can be found here.

							<strong>Additional information about "cookies" and related technologies</strong></div>
						<div>We also may provide third-party advertisers with geographic or demographic information that allows them to tailor their ads. This information does not identify you individually.</div>

This information is used to predict whether you fit within an audience an advertiser is trying to reach. In addition, using an anonymous, unique identifier we create when you register on our websites, we may allow an advertiser to use information they have about your visits to websites on a desktop computer to deliver marketing messages to mobile devices on our network.</div>
			            <div>We do not share outside of Verizon any information that identifies you personally as part of these programs. You have a choice about participating in the separate Verizon and Verizon Wireless programs.</div>

						<div class="title3">Working Together to Keep Children Safe</div>
						<div>Verizon recognizes that online service providers must be vigilant in protecting the safety and privacy of children online. We do not knowingly market to or solicit information from children under the age of 13, without obtaining verifiable parental consent.</div>
						<div>Verizon strongly supports educating parents and young Internet users on safe viewing practices and we offer a variety of tools to help children and parents avoid encountering objectionable content or communications while using our services.</div>
						<div>Verizon's <strong>Parental Control Center</strong> provides many free resources that offer guidance, connect parents with experts and help give parents the technical knowledge to help keep kids safer online.</div>
						<div>Regrettably, there are those who use the Internet to view, store and distribute child pornography (or who engage in other types of illegal activity involving children). Child pornography is subject to severe criminal penalties and using the Verizon network to view, store or distribute it violates our service contracts. The Verizon network may not be used by customers in any manner for the storage, transmission or dissemination of images containing child pornography and we will report any instances of such activity of which we become aware to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.</div>
						<div>If you have a complaint about child pornography, the soliciting of children for sexual activity, or any other illegal or inappropriate activity involving children on a Verizon service, report it to us by sending an email to abuse@verizon.net. Please include the words "child porn" in the subject line of your email.

						<div>Verizon has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of customer information we collect or store, including Social Security Numbers.

Personally identifiable and other sensitive records are retained only as long as reasonably necessary for business accounting, tax or legal purposes.</div>
						<div>Although we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, no program is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information. Verizon maintains security and incident response plans to handle incidents involving unauthorized access to private information we collect or store.</div>
